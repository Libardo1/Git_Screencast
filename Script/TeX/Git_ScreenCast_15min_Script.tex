\begin{dialogue}[warmly]{Narrator} Hello and welcome to this screencast micro-tutorial on the Git Version Control Software. \end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}{Narrator} Git is version control software.
\newline
\newline
If you have ever put numbers at the ends of file names to keep copies of different stages in your process of authoring those files you have used version control.
\newline
\newline
If you have haver used comment boxes or tracked changes to collaboratively author a file then you have also used version control.
\newline
\newline
Version control software formalises these concepts into a system which can save you a lots of time by enforcing an organisational structure and providing functionality for automatied operations within this structure.
\newline
\newline
Before I commence my demonstration of a simple workflow with the Git version control system it's worth mentioning that both Git and GitHub are exceptionally well documented online.
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}[navigating to the Git Book page]{Narrator} 
There is an entire book available on Git.
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}[switching tabs to \url{https://help.github.com/}]{Narrator} 
The GitHub help page is also excellent.
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}[switching tabs to \url{https://github.com/brfitzpatrick/Intro_to_R/blob/master/VC_with_GitHub.pdf}]{Narrator} 
Furthermore, if you find this micro-tutorial helpful I have written a longer tutorial on version control with Git and GitHub the slides for which are freely available online.
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}[switching tabs to \url{https://github.com/brfitzpatrick/}]{Narrator} 
Today I'll demonstrate the simple workflow of creating a local clone of a remote repository, making changes to your local clone then pushing those changes to the remote to bring it up to date with your local version.
\end{dialogue}

Switch to terminal and demo git clone commit push

\begin{dialogue}
This concludes the demonstration.
\newline
\newline
Hopefully you now understand the basics of version control with the Git command line application and local and remote versions of a repository. % summarise key learning points
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}[joking \& switching to \url{http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis}]{Narrator}
If you are writing code and yet are averse to using a command line interface numerous Graphical User Interfaces to the Git version control system exist.
\newline
\newline
Of particular note are the clients from GitHub and Atlassian (the provider of BitBucket).
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}[sign off, switching back to \url{http://git-scm.com}]{Narrator}
Thanks for watching, my name is Ben Fitzpatrick and with Git `everything is local'.
